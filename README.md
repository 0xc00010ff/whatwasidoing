# whatwasidoing
A todo list for errant multitaskers or single-celled organisms.

Keeps track of the **one thing** you should be focusing on.
Really a one line todo list for idiots like the author.

If you're like me you'll start working on an important task and before you know it, you've got 18 browser tabs open and you've decided to rebuild your app to be a faster than light teleportation service. "What the _fuck_ was I doing," you ask. Lo, and behold. Now you'll remember. 

### Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/0xc00010ff/whatwasidoing.git
cd whatwasidoing
sudo make install
```

### Usage:
```
command-line $ doing refactoring the spacetime combobulator
> refactoring the spacetime combobulator

command-line $ doing
> ðŸ”¹ refactoring the spacetime combobulator

command-line $ doing done
> âœ… refactoring the spacetime combobulator
```

* The todos are namespaced by directory, so your todo in ~/project1 is unaffected by that in ~/project2
