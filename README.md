# whatwasidoing
A todo list for errant multitaskers or single-celled organisms.

Keeps track of the **one thing** you should be focusing on.
Really a one line todo list for idiots like the author.

If you're like me, you'll often open an old project to find a half-completed disaster that started as a great idea but ended in a reluctant 5am ill-finish-this-first-thing-never. If only you could remember- what the *fuck* was I doing?
